I want to build an advanced To-Do List web application using:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend

PHP and MySQL for the backend

I am a complete beginner and I do NOT know how to write code yet.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:

Build the project step by step, not all at once

Explain every line of code in very simple words, like teaching a beginner

After each step, wait for my confirmation before moving to the next step

Follow best practices and clean folder structure

Use simple, readable code (no advanced shortcuts)

FEATURES REQUIRED:

User registration and login (with password hashing)

Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed

Task priority (Low, Medium, High)

Task due date

Task categories

Search and filter tasks

Data saved in MySQL database

Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

PROJECT STRUCTURE:

First, show me:

Folder structure

Required tools (XAMPP, VS Code, browser)

How frontend and backend connect

STEP 1:

Start by explaining:

What this project is

How the frontend talks to the backend

Then create the basic HTML page for the To-Do app

Do NOT move to Step 2 until I say “NEXT”.
